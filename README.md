# Cybersecurity Browser Bookmarks

This repository contains curated browser bookmarks which I have compiled over the years while working as SOC analyst, cyber security consultant, penetration tester, threat hunter and blue/red/purple team member. Some of these tools and resources I use every day, so I hope they will be of similar good use to you.

Feel free to contribute via issues or pull requests.

These bookmarks contain
* links to free online tools for everyday use in a SOC (e.g. for malware analysis, threat intelligence research)
* links to free technical resources and documentation (e.g. IoC lists, generic SIEM use cases, threat hunting ideas, data collections, adversary techniques)
* links to some offline tools (e.g. for documentation, purple team planning)
* links to similar tool & resource lists others have assembled on their GitHub
* links to relevant standards and frameworks (e.g. NISTIR, MITRE ATT&CK), further resources (e.g. HTTP status code documentation) and best pratices (e.g. CVE advisories)

These bookmarks do **NOT** contain
* an exhaustive list of all the relevant resources out there... feel free to contribute...
* relevant offline tools shipped with security distros like Kali by default
* subscription-only or similarly commercial tools and resources

Thank you to all the developers, administrators, authors and maintainers behind all the linked tools and resources!
